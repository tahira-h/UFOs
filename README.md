DRAWBACK

One drawback of this webpage is that the filter table does not provide information for the time of day (i.e. morning, afternoon, night). If there was information for "Time
of Day", then viewers of this webpage would recognize that UFO's are expected to appear mostly in the morning, afternoon, or night. 

RECOMMENTATIONS

The first recommendation for further development is to provide a section on the webpage for viewers to report their own experience of a UFO sighting. This report will provide an update to the data of UFO sighting.

The second recommendation for further development is to provide accessibility to visitors of this webpage for enlarging the screen. There are visitors of this website who cannot zoom in or out of the webpage from their device.
